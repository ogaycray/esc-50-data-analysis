# esc-50-data-analysis

Hi! This is a mini project I did on the ESC-50: Dataset for Environmental Sound Classification (can be found at https://github.com/karolpiczak/ESC-50). I did some exploratory data analysis and feature extraction, before fitting a Machine Learning model to the data. I tried a few algorithms, to see which was the best fit as well.
